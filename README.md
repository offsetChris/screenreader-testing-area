# Screenreader testing site

In partnership with the manual testing group this is a place to test common HTML and CSS structure with screenreader and browser combinations. 

## Site is hosted here: on [GithubPages](https://offsetchris.github.io/screenreader-testing-area/)

## Future considerations:
	* Recording findings for all HTML/CSS examples and browser/screenreader combinations. Writing out what the screen reader states for each. 
	* Add more examples of alternative structures or implementations. <section> vs role="region". Aria-label with title and html text in same element etc. 
	* Graph out usage per population pulling in webaim's data for screen reader usage. 
	* Adding more complex interaction and CSS display properties to test with assistive tech.
